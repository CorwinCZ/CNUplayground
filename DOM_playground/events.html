    <p>Events are typically dispatched by the implementation as a result of a user action, in response to the completion
        of a task, or to signal progress during asynchronous activity (such as a network request). Some events can be used
        to control the behavior that the implementation may take next (or undo an action that the implementation already
        took). Events in this category are said to be cancelable and the behavior they cancel is called their default action.
        Cancelable event objects can be associated with one or more 'default actions'. To cancel an event, call the preventDefault()
        method.

        }
